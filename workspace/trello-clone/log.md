# Log — trello-clone

## Turn 1

**Done**
- `gap-analyst` assessed a blank project (idea.md only: "analog of trello boards") and recommended `requirement-refiner` → `product-owner` to establish first requirements, per `turn-plan.md`.
- `requirement-refiner` wrote `01-understand/requirements.md` (FR1-FR14, NFR1-NFR5), `open-questions.md`, `assumptions.md`; `product-owner` answered all open questions and logged assumptions (single-user SPA, localStorage persistence, no backend/auth/collaboration).
- `requirements-critic` gated: `01-understand/review.md` — VERDICT: APPROVED (first pass, no bounce).
- `architect` produced `02-design/architecture.md`, `api.md`, `data-model.md`, mapping every FR/NFR to a component.
- `design-critic` gated: `02-design/review.md` — VERDICT: APPROVED (first pass, no bounce).
- `planner`/`estimator` produced `03-plan/backlog.md` (16 tasks, ordered for earliest runnable app) and `03-plan/tasks/task-001.md` through `task-016.md`.
- `developer:task-001` built the skeleton dev server (`04-build/package.json`, `04-build/src/server.js`, `public/index.html`, `app.css`, `app.js` boot with empty-state render). `code-reviewer:task-001` — VERDICT: APPROVED (first pass, `04-build/reviews/task-001-review.md`).
- `developer:task-002` built `04-build/src/public/js/storage.js` (versioned localStorage load/save with corrupt-data and empty-state handling). `code-reviewer:task-002` — VERDICT: APPROVED (first pass, `04-build/reviews/task-002-review.md`).
- No gate overrides this turn — every review gate passed on the first cycle.
- `state.json` updated: turn 1, last_action `code-reviewer:task-002`, next `developer:task-003`.

**Walkthrough**
No UI exercised this turn.

**Agent improvements**
No changes.

## Turn 2

**Done**
- `developer:task-003` built the board store (`04-build/src/public/js/store.js`): `getState`, `createBoard`, `renameBoard`, `deleteBoard`, `reorderBoards`, write-through to `storage.js`.
- `code-reviewer:task-003` gated: `04-build/reviews/task-003-review.md` — VERDICT: APPROVED (first pass, no bounce).
- No gate overrides this turn — the review passed on the first cycle.
- `state.json` updated: turn 2, last_action `code-reviewer:task-003`, next `developer:task-004`.

**Walkthrough**
No UI exercised this turn.

**Agent improvements**
No changes.

## Turn 3

**Done**
- `developer:task-004` built the boards overview UI (`04-build/src/public/js/render.js`, `events.js`, wiring in `app.js`, containers in `index.html`): create/rename/delete boards, empty state, click-to-navigate to a stub board view showing the board's title.
- `code-reviewer:task-004` gated: `04-build/reviews/task-004-review.md` — VERDICT: APPROVED (first pass, no bounce). One non-blocking future-hardening note: the delete handler in `events.js:67-72` calls `store.deleteBoard` without a try/catch (unlike create/rename), safe today because delete buttons only render for boards that exist, but flagged for symmetry when confirm-dialogs land at task-011.
- No gate overrides this turn — the review passed on the first cycle.
- `state.json` updated: turn 3, last_action `code-reviewer:task-004`, next `developer:task-015`.

**Walkthrough**
No UI exercised this turn (no `05-qa/walkthrough/turn-003/` directory produced — no `ui-tester` run yet).

**Agent improvements**
No changes.

## Turn 4

**Done**
- `gap-analyst` reassessed and confirmed `developer:task-015` as next action (Playwright harness), flagging that no execution/UI verification had touched the app across three turns of "approved first pass" reviews.
- `developer:task-015` built the Playwright test harness: `05-qa/playwright.config.js` (webServer auto-starts `04-build/src/server.js` on port 4173), `05-qa/tests/smoke.spec.js` (empty state → create board → verify → reload → verify persistence), `05-qa/package.json`/`package-lock.json` (`@playwright/test` devDependency + `test` script), and a doc update to `04-build/src/README.md` with the run instructions.
- `code-reviewer:task-015` gated: `04-build/reviews/task-015-review.md` — VERDICT: APPROVED (first pass, no bounce). Confirmed selectors match real markup/render code, the new dependency is a documented exception to the "no dependencies" architecture principle (already called out in `architecture.md`'s Tech Stack table and `backlog.md`'s Risks section), and `node_modules`/`test-results`/`playwright-report` are all covered by the root `.gitignore` so nothing extraneous will be committed.
- `03-plan/backlog.md` updated: task-015 marked DONE.
- No gate overrides this turn — the review passed on the first cycle.
- `state.json` updated: turn 4, last_action `code-reviewer:task-015`, next `developer:task-005`.

**Walkthrough**
No UI exercised this turn (task-015 built the test harness itself; no `ui-tester` run or `05-qa/walkthrough/turn-004/` directory produced this turn — the smoke test now exists for a future turn to run and report on).

**Agent improvements**
No changes (`reflections.md` remains empty this turn — no `CHANGES_REQUESTED` cycles occurred to trigger an evidence-gated self-edit; no `[PROBATION]` entries pending resolution in `evolution/ledger.md`).

## Turn 5

**Done**
- `gap-analyst` reassessed and recommended `developer:task-005` as the next action (lists), while flagging two carried-over gaps for future turns: the Playwright smoke test still hasn't been executed even once (built turn 4, still zero pass/fail evidence), and `architecture.md`'s stale "no dependencies" line remains unfixed after three consecutive flags.
- `developer:task-005` built list operations in `04-build/src/public/js/store.js` (`createList`, `renameList`, `deleteList` with card cascade, `reorderLists`), extended `deleteBoard`'s cascade to also remove lists/cards, and built the board-view UI (`render.js`'s `renderBoardView`, `events.js` handlers, `index.html` containers) to render/create/rename/delete lists.
- `code-reviewer:task-005` gated: `04-build/reviews/task-005-review.md` — VERDICT: APPROVED (first pass, no bounce). Confirmed cascade completeness (board delete now cascades through lists to cards), consistent error-handling pattern, no leftover debug code, and correctly scoped forward references to task-006 (cards) and task-011 (confirm dialogs).
- `03-plan/backlog.md` updated: task-005 marked DONE.
- No gate overrides this turn — the review passed on the first cycle.
- `state.json` updated: turn 5, last_action `code-reviewer:task-005`, next `developer:task-006`.

**Walkthrough**
No UI exercised this turn (no `05-qa/walkthrough/turn-5/` directory produced — no `ui-tester` run this turn; the Playwright smoke test built in turn 4 still has not been executed even once, a gap now flagged for four consecutive turns).

**Agent improvements**
No changes (`reflections.md` remains empty this turn — no `CHANGES_REQUESTED` cycles occurred to trigger an evidence-gated self-edit; no `[PROBATION]` entries pending resolution in `evolution/ledger.md`).

## Turn 6

**Done**
- `gap-analyst` reassessed and recommended `developer:task-006` as the next action (cards — the core entity making this a Trello clone), while flagging that the Playwright smoke test built in turn 4 still has never been executed (two turns running) and that `architecture.md`'s stale "no dependencies" line has now gone unfixed for four consecutive turns.
- `developer:task-006` built card operations in `04-build/src/public/js/store.js` (`createCard`, `renameCard`, `deleteCard` with FK validation via `findList`/`findCard`) and extended `deleteList`'s cascade to remove associated cards; extended `render.js` (`renderCards`) and `events.js` to render/create/rename/delete cards within lists in the board view.
- `code-reviewer:task-006` gated: `04-build/reviews/task-006-review.md` — VERDICT: APPROVED (first pass, no bounce). Confirmed cascade completeness (list delete now cascades to cards), FR10 empty-state rendering, consistent error-handling pattern, and persistence via `storage.js` write-through. One cosmetic-only note (redundant destructuring in `events.js:151`), not blocking.
- `03-plan/backlog.md` updated: task-006 marked DONE.
- No gate overrides this turn — the review passed on the first cycle.
- `state.json` updated: turn 6, last_action `code-reviewer:task-006`, next `qa-engineer`.

**Walkthrough**
No UI exercised this turn (no `05-qa/walkthrough/turn-006/` directory produced — no `ui-tester` run this turn; the Playwright smoke test built in turn 4 still has not been executed even once, a gap now flagged for five consecutive turns and slated as the top-priority action for turn 7 via `qa-engineer`).

**Agent improvements**
No changes (`reflections.md` remains empty this turn — no `CHANGES_REQUESTED` cycles occurred to trigger an evidence-gated self-edit; no `[PROBATION]` entries pending resolution in `evolution/ledger.md`).
